# Evaluation Contracts

These contracts describe the repository's Hermes integration. Select the gate that tests the changed behavior and read its contract before running it. Paths below are relative to the `eval` skill directory unless a command starts from the repository root.

## Dev-cycle contract

`references/dev-cycle-scenarios.json` is the fixed v2, 18-scenario contract for current-phase routing in the integrated development workflow.

- `scripts/validate_dev_cycle.py` is the structural gate. It checks required workflow text, skill isolation, skill existence, and reference links against a git baseline and the working tree. It does not prove model routing behavior.
- `scripts/run_dev_cycle_behavior.py` is the routing-decision oracle. Fresh Hermes processes predict the current-phase procedure and preserve the next user-owned gate for the same scenario prompts with each unique baseline or candidate policy bundle. Capabilities and principles describe only the current phase; at a checkpoint, stop without assuming approval or including later-phase procedures. Review axes are expected only when `code-review` is the current phase. Identical policy hashes share one fresh decision and the candidate is recorded as an alias, preventing a no-op comparison from becoming a sampling regression. Shared failures remain comparative evidence but do not block an unchanged candidate; failures from a fresh candidate policy remain blocking. The model prompt is variant-neutral; baseline and candidate attribution is recorded in report metadata. The runner records modes, current-phase capabilities and principles, checkpoints, questions before evidence, testing methods, architecture styles, review axes, and structured verification intentions. It rejects unknown, forbidden, and scenario-unexpected skills, validates every declared route field strictly so malformed output is a deterministic failure, and records hashes for the runner, matrix, and policy bundles. The matrix itself is an immutable contract: the runner fails the run if the candidate scenario matrix no longer matches an embedded SHA-256. This routing prediction does not prove skill loading, context placement, tool execution, or slash-command dispatch.

Run the structural gate with `python3 skills/eval/scripts/validate_dev_cycle.py --baseline-ref HEAD`. Run the behavioral gate with `python3 skills/eval/scripts/run_dev_cycle_behavior.py --baseline-ref HEAD`. A baseline or shared-policy failure is comparative evidence; any failure from a fresh candidate policy is a blocking regression.

## Subagent contract

`references/subagent-scenarios.json` is the fixed v2 behavior contract for bounded work delegated to DeepSeek. It covers Standards, Spec, and Adversarial review, read-only investigation, and blast-radius analysis. It excludes routing, implementation, checkpoints, and other responsibilities owned by the main model.

`scripts/run_subagent_behavior.py` runs each scenario independently through `deepseek-v4-flash` on `opencode-go`. Each scenario includes supported claims and distractors, while the expected classification remains outside the model prompt. The runner requires exact evidence anchors, strict JSON, read-only behavior, no further delegation, and a complete partition of candidate claims. It repeats every scenario three times by default. Parse and transport failures receive one retry; semantic failures are never retried. Any candidate failure is blocking, including a failure shared with an identical baseline policy.

Run the blocking gate with `python3 skills/eval/scripts/run_subagent_behavior.py --baseline-ref HEAD`. Use `--repetitions 1` only for local runner debugging, never as release evidence.

## Coding-standards contract

`references/coding-standards-scenarios.json` fixes the behavior contract for cognitive complexity, validated types, contextual rules, trusted internal values, established facts, and architecture-neutral input handling. `scripts/run_coding_standards_behavior.py` compares `coding-standards/SKILL.md` at the git baseline and in the working tree, rejects malformed decisions, and embeds the immutable matrix hash. Run it with `python3 skills/eval/scripts/run_coding_standards_behavior.py --baseline-ref HEAD` whenever coding philosophy or validation behavior changes.

## Tool-execution contract

`references/tool-use-scenarios.json` fixes the execution contract for repository search, file reading and editing, command execution, delegation, structured questions, visible task tracking, skill discovery and loading, session-history retrieval, and unavailable-capability behavior. `scripts/run_tool_use_behavior.py` materializes the pinned baseline and candidate skill trees in separate temporary Hermes homes, starts fresh sessions, exports authoritative runtime traces, and checks matched tool results, child session records, fixture writes, and required artifacts. It interleaves baseline and candidate jobs while serializing delegation-heavy parent runs, because each isolated Hermes home enforces only its own child limit. Expected observations remain outside model prompts. The structured-question scenario uses an isolated callback that supplies synthetic fixture answers; it does not question the real user or authorize work outside the fixture.

Run the release gate with `python3 skills/eval/scripts/run_tool_use_behavior.py --baseline-ref HEAD`. Its default is three fresh repetitions per scenario and policy bundle. Use `--repetitions 1 --scenario <id>` only for runner debugging. A candidate semantic failure blocks release. Transport or malformed-trace failures receive at most one recorded retry. A tool name in prose or a model self-report never counts as execution.

This gate is a Hermes integration test. A passing report supports only the recorded Hermes version, model, provider, tool configuration, and fixture hashes. It is not proof for an untested harness.
