# To Tickets

Break a complete, approved spec into a set of **tickets**: tracer-bullet vertical slices, each declaring the tickets that **block** it and the `/architect` layer(s) it touches.

Use `/architect`'s selected sketch, ownership, bounded-context, and threat-model decisions as inputs.

**This step is user-invoked**: do not start it on your own; the user triggers it explicitly.

The issue tracker and issue-label vocabulary should have been provided to you. Tell the user to run `/dev-cycle-setup` if not; it's user-invoked, so you can't call it yourself.

Read `writing-for-agents` before drafting ticket bodies. Its general writing rules govern this document; the ticket template below adds only ticket-specific structure. Resolve the configured `ready-for-agent` state label through `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` rather than assuming the canonical name is the tracker label.

## Capabilities and principles

Load the canonical owner when its trigger fires:

- `blast-radius` determines whether work is a narrow tracer bullet or a wide migration and identifies the consumers each ticket must account for.
- `principle-sequence-verifiable-units` makes every ticket end in a checkable green or measured state.
- `principle-build-the-lever` creates an enabling ticket when automation or a focused harness is cheaper and safer than repeated manual work.
- `principle-migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis` places expansion, caller batches, and contraction in dependency order without leaving two permanent APIs.
- `hillclimb` makes each measurement ticket one hypothesis, one change, one measurement, and one keep-or-revert verdict against the frozen harness.

Record the concrete ticket boundary or blocking edge each principle changed. Do not copy the specialist procedure into ticket bodies.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from the complete approved spec. If the user passes a reference (a spec path, an issue number or URL) as an argument, fetch it and read its full body and comments. If the available material is only a plan, conversation, or incomplete issue, stop and hand off to `to-spec` rather than drafting tickets.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code. Ticket titles and descriptions should use `docs/agents/domain.md`'s glossary vocabulary, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Look for opportunities to prefactor the code to make the implementation easier. "Make the change easy, then make the easy change."

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the work into **tracer bullet** tickets.

First decide whether the approved spec describes one independently implementable slice or multiple slices. If it is one slice, report that `to-tickets` would add no value and stop. Do not publish a redundant ticket.

Budget: at most 5 tickets per spec. A spec that needs more is describing more than one unit of work; say so and propose the split before publishing anything. A ticket carries at most 5 acceptance criteria, each an observable behavior; a sixth criterion means the ticket delivers two behaviors and is two tickets.

<vertical-slice-rules>

- Each slice cuts a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer it touches (Handler → Service → Repository, per `/architect`). It is vertical, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own, with its Service-layer/Domain-Type behaviour covered by `/testing`'s unit-test scope
- Each slice is sized to fit in a single fresh context window
- Any prefactoring should be done first

</vertical-slice-rules>

Give each ticket its **blocking edges**, meaning the other tickets that must complete before it can start, and its **layer(s)**: which of Handler/Service/Repository/Middleware it touches, and which bounded context. A ticket with no blockers can start immediately.

**Wide refactors are the exception to vertical slicing.** A **wide refactor** is one mechanical change, such as renaming a column or retyping a shared symbol, whose **blast radius** fans across the whole codebase, so a single edit breaks thousands of call sites at once and no vertical slice can land green. Don't force it into a tracer bullet; sequence it as **expand–contract**. First expand: add the new form beside the old so nothing breaks. Then migrate the call sites over in batches sized by blast radius (per package, per directory), each batch its own ticket blocked by the expand, keeping CI green batch to batch because the old form still exists. Finally contract: delete the old form once no caller remains, in a ticket blocked by every migrate batch. When even the batches can't stay green alone, keep the sequence but let them share an integration branch that all block a final integrate-and-verify ticket. Green is promised only there.

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each ticket, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Layer(s)**: which `/architect` layer(s) and bounded context this touches
- **Blocked by**: which other tickets (if any) must complete first
- **What it delivers**: the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the blocking edges correct? Does each ticket only depend on tickets that genuinely gate it?
- Should any tickets be merged or split further?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Publish the tickets to the configured tracker

Publish the approved tickets in dependency order (blockers first) so each ticket's blocking edges can reference real identifiers. Use the tracker's native blocking / sub-issue relationship. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`'s "Tracer-bullet ticket operations" section. Apply the configured `ready-for-agent` state label unless instructed otherwise: the tickets are agent-grabbable by construction.

Work the **frontier**: any ticket whose blockers are all done. For a purely linear chain that means top to bottom.

Do NOT close or modify any parent issue.

<issue-template>

## Parent

A reference to the parent issue on the tracker (if the source was an existing issue or a `/wayfinder` map, otherwise omit this section).

## Layer(s)

Handler / Service / Repository / Middleware, per `/architect`, and the bounded context.

## What to build

The end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work, from the user's perspective, not layer-by-layer implementation.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Blocked by

- A reference to each blocking ticket, or "None: can start immediately".

</issue-template>

Avoid specific file paths or code snippets. They go stale fast. Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts rather than a working demo; include just the important bits.
