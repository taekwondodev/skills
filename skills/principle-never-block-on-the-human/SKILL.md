# Never Block on the Human

The human supervises asynchronously. Agents should stay unblocked on facts and reversible preparation. Make reasonable operational decisions, proceed, and let the human course-correct after the fact. Stop when the work reaches a product, scope, architecture, contract, security, or other decision that requires human ownership.

**Why:** Every unnecessary permission pause stalls the pipeline and makes the human the bottleneck. Facts can be observed and reversible preparation can be reviewed later. Product, scope, architecture, contract, and security decisions are different: silently choosing one transfers ownership without consent.

**Pattern:**
- **Proceed, then present.** Do observable research and reversible preparation, then show the result. Do not ask "should I do X?" when running X is the fastest way to produce evidence.
- **Reserve questions for decisions.** Ask when the choice changes product behavior, scope, architecture, a contract, security, or another decision the human owns.
- **Make the system self-healing.** When you notice a problem, log it and fix it in the next round.
- **Supervision is async where safe.** The human can review research, prototypes, tests, and reversible diffs after the fact. Do not use async review to hide an unresolved ownership decision.
- **Code is cheap, attention is scarce.** A wrong implementation costs minutes to fix. A blocked agent costs the human's attention to unblock.

**Boundaries:**
- **Irreversible actions** (force-push, delete production data, send external messages) still require confirmation.
- **Reversible actions** (research, prototypes, tests, and clearly scoped local edits) should proceed without blocking.
- **Product, scope, architecture, contract, and security direction** comes from the human; execution may proceed only after the decision is settled.
