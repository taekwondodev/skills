description: Resolve decisions through evidence, investigation, and a structured design tree.

# Grilling

Interview the user until the decision tree is complete and shared understanding is reached. Before asking a question, determine whether it is a fact, a hypothesis, or a decision. Facts belong to tools and investigation. Decisions belong to the user.

This skill resolves open decisions. It does not publish a spec or implement code. It may investigate, prototype, profile, or run read-only forensics before asking questions.

Grill only the decisions the work actually opens. A small change usually has zero or one; state it, get the answer, and stop. The size of the ledger follows the size of the change, never the other way round.

## Pre-flight

Read the relevant domain context, ADRs, README material, design documents, issue evidence, and current conversation before the first decision round.

Treat an explicit, unambiguous decision in these sources as settled. Do not ask it again. If sources conflict, ask about the conflict after presenting the evidence.

## Design tree

Keep a ledger of:

- settled decisions and their source;
- facts verified by tools;
- hypotheses still being tested;
- questions already asked;
- decisions still at the frontier;
- capabilities activated and their completion status.

The frontier contains only decisions whose prerequisites are settled. Recompute it after every user answer or investigation result.

## Classify before asking

For every apparent question, classify it first.

### Fact

A fact can be observed from the repository, runtime, tool output, documentation, issue tracker, or another accessible source. Investigate it. Do not ask the user.

### Hypothesis

A hypothesis can be tested with a probe, prototype, benchmark, or forensic artifact. Test it when the result is cheaper and safer than asking.

### Decision

A decision changes product behavior, scope, architecture, ownership, contracts, security, or user preference. Present it with the available structured user-question capability.

When uncertain, do not silently convert a decision into an agent preference. State the evidence and ask.

## Investigation capabilities

Load only the specialist skill that matches the uncertainty. The specialist owns its procedure; `grilling` owns the trigger and reintegrates its evidence into the design tree. Consume the selected specialist's declared result contract, verify its evidence, and update the ledger directly rather than requesting a prose report.

- Load `how` for current code flow, ownership, layering, and runtime walkthroughs.
- Load `why` for rationale, historical decisions, regressions, ADRs, and non-obvious constraints.
- Load `investigation` for a read-only question, unknown cause, or bug reproduction.
- Load `prototype` when an empirical technical fork is cheaper to test than discuss.
- Load `runtime-forensics` when the symptom exists in a live process.
- Load `trace-forensics` when the user supplies an existing profile, trace, snapshot, or spindump.
- Load `perf-issue` for one measured performance problem.
- Load `hillclimb` for sustained improvement against a fixed metric and stop predicate.

Completion criterion: the specialist returns sourced evidence, a reproducible observation, or an explicit unresolved uncertainty; the design tree records what changed and recomputes the frontier.

## Architecture escalation

When investigation reveals an unsettled data shape, module boundary, ownership model, dependency direction, public interface, bounded context, or security boundary, activate `architect`.

`architect` grounds the system, creates the sketch, uses `arena` for genuinely contested alternatives, and proceeds without an automatic checkpoint. Ask for a checkpoint only when the user explicitly wants to review the sketch before implementation.

## User questions

For each decision round, use the available structured user-question capability. If it is unavailable, ask in ordinary chat while preserving the same checkpoint and state that the structured interaction was unavailable.

- Present concrete alternatives as selectable options when the capability supports them.
- Keep alternatives out of the question text when the capability has a separate options field.
- Put the most likely current path first, without presenting it as mandatory.
- Batch independent frontier questions in one structured interaction.
- Sequence questions when one answer changes the next question.
- If the user adds context or corrects an assumption, stop the current round and regenerate the affected frontier.

## Checkpoint and handoff

The grilling session ends only when every reachable branch of the design tree is settled and the user confirms shared understanding.

Then stop. For a human-facing handoff, summarize only the decisions, decisive evidence, rejected alternatives, principles that changed choices, unresolved risks, and recommended next phase. For an agent-facing handoff, use the result contract below without a second prose report.

Do not start any other skill automatically. The user invokes the next step.

## Agent result

For a return to another skill, load [decision/1](../arena/references/result-contract.md). Carry settled decisions and the next completion criterion; unresolved user choices remain limits.

## Verification

Before handing off, confirm:

- every question asked was a genuine user-owned decision;
- every investigated fact has a source or reproducible observation;
- hypotheses are marked confirmed, rejected, or unresolved;
- the frontier is empty;
- no silent product, scope, architecture, or security choice remains;
- the handoff names the next completion criterion.
